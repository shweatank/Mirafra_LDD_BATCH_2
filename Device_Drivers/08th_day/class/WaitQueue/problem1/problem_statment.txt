Problem Statement: Wait Queue Implementation in a Linux Device Driver

In Linux kernel programming, wait queues are used to put processes to sleep until a specific condition becomes true, helping manage synchronization in concurrent environments. Your task is to implement a basic Linux character device driver that uses a wait queue to block and wake up user-space processes based on a condition set within the kernel.

Objective:
Write a Linux kernel module that implements a character device. The driver must:

Allow a user-space process to read from the device. If a certain condition is not met (e.g., a flag is unset), the process should sleep on a wait queue.

Another user-space process can write to the device to change the condition (e.g., set the flag), which should wake up any processes waiting on the queue.

Properly handle concurrent access, module initialization, and cleanup.

Requirements:
Use wait_queue_head_t, wait_event_interruptible() (or similar functions) for putting the process to sleep.

Use wake_up_interruptible() to wake waiting processes.

Implement standard file operations: open, read, write, and release.

Maintain proper synchronization and cleanup in module_exit.

Bonus (Optional):
Add a timeout to the wait queue sleep.

Support multiple sleeping readers.
